## Machine-Deep-Learning-Enchantment-My-90-Day-Challenge-to-Master-the-Art-of-AI

Welcome to my repository for the 90 Days bootcamp where i will be diving deeper into the hidden secrets of Machine Learning and Deep Learning! Over the next 90 days, I'll be documenting my progress as I work through the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron and complete other machine learning and deep learning projects.

### Days

####1. [Day 1](./day1): Introduction to Machine Learning

  - The chapter introduces the concepts of machine learning, its applications, and its importance in today's world.
  - It explains the difference between traditional programming and machine learning, where the latter involves training a model to find patterns in data and make predictions or           decisions.
  - The three main categories of machine learning are introduced: supervised learning (where the data is labeled), unsupervised learning (where the data is unlabeled), and reinforcement learning (where the model learns by trial and error through interactions with an environment).
  - The chapter discusses the most common types of supervised learning problems: classification (where the model predicts a categorical label) and regression (where the model predicts a continuous numerical value).
  - The importance of preparing the data before feeding it to a machine learning model is emphasized, and the common steps involved in data preparation (such as cleaning, scaling, and feature engineering) are briefly explained.

####2. [Day 2](./day2): Setting up the environment

  Today, I started by setting up my environment and exploring the titanic famous dataset. Here's a breakdown of what I accomplished today:

- Installed the Anaconda environment and the necessary packages for machine learning, including Jupyter, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, and the latest version of Python.
- Downloaded the titnic dataset from the author's GitHub repository and loaded it into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Explored the dataset using various Pandas functions to get a better understanding of its structure and features.
- Visualized the distribution of the target variable using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Cleaned the data by removing missing values and creating new features.
- Visualized the correlation between the features and the target variable using a heatmap.

I also spent some time familiarizing myself with Jupyter Notebooks and the various shortcuts and plugins available for data visualization in machine learning. Overall, it was a productive start to the challenge, and I'm excited to continue learning and building my machine learning skills.
